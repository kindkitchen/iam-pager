# Changelog

## 2026-07-21

- Concentrated the repository on the current product while preserving its
  behavior and interface boundaries. More than 21,000 lines were removed across
  release-transition storage code, disconnected page adapters, migration and
  database-release machinery, repeated composition coverage, compatibility-only
  branches, redundant helpers, generated dependency state, specifications, and
  closed task histories. `PageAggregateRepository` is the sole page persistence
  contract; memory and strict Deno KV implementations retain shared conformance,
  atomic visibility, and verified content staging. The specification and API now
  describe current requirements, and all closed work is represented by one
  two-file project baseline rather than intermediate or rejected states. The
  focused 441-test suite, repository checks, and production build pass.
